# Bank Marketing Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the success of a bank marketing campaign using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains information about clients, their interactions with the bank, and the outcome of the marketing campaign. The goal is to build a predictive model that can help the bank identify potential clients who are likely to subscribe  or not to the term deposit.

#### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is banking.csv. It contains various features such as age, job, marital status, education, and information about the last contact with the client, among others.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explore the dataset to gain insights into the data distribution, relationships between features, and identify potential patterns.

#### Data Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features. 

#### Feature Engineering
Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the model's performance. 

#### Model Building
Build and train machine learning models using the preprocessed data. Evaluate different algorithms and choose the best-performing one. 

#### Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics and visualize the results.
